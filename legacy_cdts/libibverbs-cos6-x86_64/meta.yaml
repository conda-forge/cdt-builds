  summary: "(CDT) A library for direct userspace use of RDMA (InfiniBand/iWARP) hardware"
  description: |
        libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA "verbs" as
        described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and the RDMA Protocol
        Verbs Specification.  This includes direct hardware access from userspace to
        InfiniBand/iWARP adapters (kernel bypass) for fast path operations.  For this
        library to be useful, a device-specific plug-in module should also be
        installed.
