  summary: (CDT) Common Unix Printing System - libraries
  description: |
    The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for UNIXÂ®
    operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software Products to promote
    a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users. CUPS provides the
    System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces. The cups-libs package provides
    libraries used by applications to use CUPS natively, without needing the
    lp/lpr commands.
