  summary: (CDT) Libraries, includes, etc. to develop XML and HTML applications
  description: |
    Libraries, include files, etc you can use to develop XML applications. This
    library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes support to read, modify
    and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes parsing and
    validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later once the
    document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or and in-
    memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in XPath
    and XPointer implementation to select sub nodes or ranges. A flexible
    Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and
    combined to an URI library.
