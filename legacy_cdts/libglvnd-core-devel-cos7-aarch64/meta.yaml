  summary: "(CDT) Core development files for libglvnd"
  description: |
        The libglvnd-core-devel package is a bootstrap trick for Mesa, which wants to
        build against the libglvnd headers but does not link against any of its
        libraries (and, initially, has file conflicts with them). If you are not Mesa
        you almost certainly want libglvnd-devel instead.
