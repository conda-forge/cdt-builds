  summary: (CDT) An XML parser library
  description: |
    This is expat, the C library for parsing XML, written by James Clark. Expat is
    a stream oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with the
    parser prior to starting the parse. These handlers are called when the parser
    discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A start tag
    is an example of the kind of structures for which you may register handlers.
