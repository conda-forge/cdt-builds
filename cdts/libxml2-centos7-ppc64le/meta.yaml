  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.
  # we therefore list all possible values in CBC and skip those we don't want;
  # use in a selector ensures that the `distro` variable shows up in the hash

  summary: (CDT) Library providing XML and HTML support
  description: |
    This library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes support to read,
    modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support this includes
    parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either at parse time or later
    once the document has been modified. The output can be a simple SAX stream or
    and in-memory DOM like representations. In this case one can use the built-in
    XPath and XPointer implementation to select sub nodes or ranges. A flexible
    Input/Output mechanism is available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and
    combined to an URI library.
