  summary: (CDT) The standard CrackLib dictionaries
  description: |
    The cracklib-dicts package includes the CrackLib dictionaries. CrackLib will
    need to use the dictionary appropriate to your system, which is normally put
    in /usr/share/dict/words. Cracklib-dicts also contains the utilities necessary
    for the creation of new dictionaries.  If you are installing CrackLib, you
    should also install cracklib-dicts.
