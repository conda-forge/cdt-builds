  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.
  # we therefore list all possible values in CBC and skip those we don't want;
  # use in a selector ensures that the `distro` variable shows up in the hash
  skip: true  # [distro != "centos7"]

  summary: (CDT) A 2D graphics library
  description: |
    Cairo is a 2D graphics library designed to provide high-quality display and
    print output. Currently supported output targets include the X Window System,
    in-memory image buffers, and image files (PDF, PostScript, and SVG).  Cairo is
    designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking
    advantage of display hardware acceleration when available.
