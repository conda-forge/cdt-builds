  summary: (CDT) A library for direct userspace use of RDMA (InfiniBand/iWARP) hardware
  description: |
    libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA "verbs" as
    described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and the RDMA Protocol
    Verbs Specification.  This includes direct hardware access from userspace to
    InfiniBand/iWARP adapters (kernel bypass) for fast path operations.  For this
    library to be useful, a device-specific plug-in module should also be
    installed.
