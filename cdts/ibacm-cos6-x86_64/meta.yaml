  summary: "(CDT) InfiniBand Communication Manager Assistant"
  description: |
        The ib_acm daemon helps reduce the load of managing path record lookups on
        large InfiniBand fabrics by providing a user space implementation of what is
        functionally similar to an ARP cache.  The use of ib_acm, when properly
        configured, can reduce the SA packet load of a large IB cluster from O(n^2) to
        O(n).  The ib_acm daemon is started and normally runs in the background, user
        applications need not know about this daemon as long as their app uses
        librdmacm to handle connection bring up/tear down.  The librdmacm library
        knows how to talk directly to the ib_acm daemon to retrieve data.
