  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.
  # we therefore list all possible values in CBC and skip those we don't want;
  # use in a selector ensures that the `distro` variable shows up in the hash

  summary: (CDT) CUPS printing system - libraries
  description: |
    CUPS printing system provides a portable printing layer for UNIXÂ® operating
    systems. It has been developed by Apple Inc. to promote a standard printing
    solution for all UNIX vendors and users. CUPS provides the System V and
    Berkeley command-line interfaces. The cups-libs package provides libraries
    used by applications to use CUPS natively, without needing the lp/lpr
    commands.
