  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.
  # we therefore list all possible values in CBC and skip those we don't want;
  # use in a selector ensures that the `distro` variable shows up in the hash

  summary: (CDT) Universally unique ID library
  description: |
    This is the universally unique ID development library and headers, part of
    util-linux.  The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally
    unique id's (UUID's).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
    space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can be used
    for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime,
    to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.  See also
    the "uuid-devel" package, which is a separate implementation.
