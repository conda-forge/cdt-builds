  summary: "(CDT) Library of functions for manipulating TIFF format image files"
  description: |
        The libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating TIFF
        (Tagged Image File Format) image format files.  TIFF is a widely used file
        format for bitmapped images.  TIFF files usually end in the .tif extension and
        they are often quite large.  The libtiff package should be installed if you
        need to manipulate TIFF format image files.
