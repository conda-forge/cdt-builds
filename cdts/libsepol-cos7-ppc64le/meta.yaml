  summary: (CDT) SELinux binary policy manipulation library
  description: |
    Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux® kernel and a number of
    utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory
    access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
    architectural components originally developed to improve the security of the
    Flask operating system. These architectural components provide general support
    for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control policies,
    including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
    Control, and Multi-level Security.  libsepol provides an API for the
    manipulation of SELinux binary policies. It is used by checkpolicy (the policy
    compiler) and similar tools, as well as by programs like load_policy that need
    to perform specific transformations on binary policies such as customizing
    policy boolean settings.
