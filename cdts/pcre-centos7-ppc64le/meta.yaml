  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.

  summary: "(CDT) Perl-compatible regular expression library"
  description: |
        Perl-compatible regular expression library. PCRE has its own native API, but a
        set of "wrapper" functions that are based on the POSIX API are also supplied
        in the library libpcreposix. Note that this just provides a POSIX calling
        interface to PCRE: the regular expressions themselves still follow Perl syntax
        and semantics. The header file for the POSIX-style functions is called
        pcreposix.h.
