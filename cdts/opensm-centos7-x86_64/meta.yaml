  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.

  summary: (CDT) OpenIB InfiniBand Subnet Manager and management utilities
  description: |
    OpenSM is the OpenIB project's Subnet Manager for Infiniband networks. The
    subnet manager is run as a system daemon on one of the machines in the
    infiniband fabric to manage the fabric's routing state.  This package also
    contains various tools for diagnosing and testing Infiniband networks that can
    be used from any machine and do not need to be run on a machine running the
    opensm daemon.
