  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.
  # we therefore list all possible values in CBC and skip those we don't want;
  # use in a selector ensures that the `distro` variable shows up in the hash

  summary: (CDT) InfiniBand Communication Manager Assistant
  description: |
    The ibacm daemon helps reduce the load of managing path record lookups on
    large InfiniBand fabrics by providing a user space implementation of what is
    functionally similar to an ARP cache.  The use of ibacm, when properly
    configured, can reduce the SA packet load of a large IB cluster from O(n^2) to
    O(n).  The ibacm daemon is started and normally runs in the background, user
    applications need not know about this daemon as long as their app uses
    librdmacm to handle connection bring up/tear down.  The librdmacm library
    knows how to talk directly to the ibacm daemon to retrieve data.
