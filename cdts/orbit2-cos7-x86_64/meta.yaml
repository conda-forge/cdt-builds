  summary: "(CDT) A high-performance CORBA Object Request Broker"
  description: |
        ORBit is a high-performance CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
        ORB (object request broker). It allows programs to send requests and receive
        replies from other programs, regardless of the locations of the two programs.
        CORBA is an architecture that enables communication between program objects,
        regardless of the programming language they're written in or the operating
        system they run on.  You will need to install this package and ORBit-devel if
        you want to write programs that use CORBA technology.
