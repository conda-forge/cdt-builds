  summary: (CDT) Convenience libraries sitting on top of libxcb
  description: |
    The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of libxcb,
    the core X protocol library, and some of the extension libraries. These
    experimental libraries provide convenience functions and interfaces which make
    the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the libraries also provide client-side
    code which is not strictly part of the X protocol but which have traditionally
    been provided by Xlib.
