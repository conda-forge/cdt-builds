  summary: (CDT) A password-checking library
  description: |
    CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match certain security-
    oriented characteristics, with the purpose of stopping users from choosing
    passwords that are easy to guess. CrackLib performs several tests on
    passwords: it tries to generate words from a username and gecos entry and
    checks those words against the password; it checks for simplistic patterns in
    passwords; and it checks for the password in a dictionary.  CrackLib is
    actually a library containing a particular C function which is used to check
    the password, as well as other C functions. CrackLib is not a replacement for
    a passwd program; it must be used in conjunction with an existing passwd
    program.  Install the cracklib package if you need a program to check users'
    passwords to see if they are at least minimally secure. If you install
    CrackLib, you will also want to install the cracklib-dicts package.
