  # this skip is here because we need different package hashes per distro.
  # we therefore list all possible values in CBC and skip those we don't want;
  # use in a selector ensures that the `distro` variable shows up in the hash

  summary: (CDT) Universally unique ID library
  description: |
    This is the universally unique ID library, part of util-linux.  The libuuid
    library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique id's (UUID's).  A UUID
    is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to
    the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from
    tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying very
    persistent objects across a network.  See also the "uuid" package, which is a
    separate implementation.
