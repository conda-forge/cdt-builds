  description: |
    The cracklib-dicts package includes the CrackLib dictionaries. CrackLib will

    in /usr/share/dict/words. Cracklib-dicts also contains the utilities necessary
    for the creation of new dictionaries.  If you are installing CrackLib, you
    should also install cracklib-dicts.
