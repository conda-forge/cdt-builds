conda-forge Core Dependency Tree (CDT) builds


## `cdt_slugs.yaml` Configuration Options

The following options are available when adding a CDT in the configuration file:

 - `custom` (boolean): Set to `true` to declare the CDT as a custom CDT. This will
   cause the CDT generation code to remove any instance of the CDT that appears in the
   `cdts` directory.
 - `license_file` (str or list of str or null): Sets the license file for a CDT. If set to
   a string or a list of strings giving the paths to the files, it will copy the licenses
   to the recipe and modify the recipe `meta.yaml` appropriately. If set to `null`, it will
   remove the `license_file` key from the `meta.yaml`.
 - `build_append` (dict mapping dist-arch to a string): Set this key to append code to the
   `build.sh` file for a given distribution and platform. For example, one might set a key
   `cos6-x86_64` in this mapping and set the value to `echo 'hi!'` to add `echo 'hi!'` to
   the build script for only `cos6-x86_64`.
 - `dep_remove` (list of strings): Set to a list of strings for deps that should be remove
 - `dep_replace` (dict mapping dep to replace to new dep): Set to a dict of deps to be
   replaced by another dep. this can be used for aliased RPMs.


## Adding a CDT package

To add a CDT package, make a PR on this repo with the following changes.

1. Add the name of the CDT `cdt_slugs.yaml` file.
2. Run the python script `gen_cdt_recipes.py`. This script will generate the
   CDT recipes that do not exist. Pass `--force` to regenerate all of the
   CDT recipes (takes about 10-20 minutes to complete).
3. Commit any changes from steps 1+2 and open the PR.

The CI service will build the CDTs, report any errors, etc.


## Changing the CDT generation script `rpm.py`

If you make changes to the CDT generation script, make a PR on this repo using
the following steps.

1. Make sure the bump the `cdt_build_number` variable in the `conda_build_config.yaml` file.
2. Run the python script `gen_cdt_recipes.py`. This script will generate the
   CDT recipes that do not exist. Pass `--force` to regenerate all of the
   CDT recipes (takes about 10-20 minutes to complete).
3. Commit any changes from steps 1+2 and open the PR.

The CI service will build the CDTs, report any errors, etc.


## Making Custom CDT recipes

If you have a CDT recipe that is not autogenerated, it can be added as follows.

1. Add the CDT name to the `cdt_slugs.yaml` file. Make sure to set `custom: true`
   in the metadata in the file.
2. Add the CDT recipe in a directory under the full CDT package name in the
   `custom_cdts` folder. If you do not know, ask someone on `conda-forge/core`.
3. Commit any changes from steps 1+2 and open the PR.

The CI service will build the CDTs, report any errors, etc.


## CDTs constraints

CDTs are meant to work with conda-forge compilers that depend on the
`sysroot_{conda subdir}` packages.

- needs to have `no_hoist` in the source sections
- sysroot directory has `conda` only in the path
- needs to have a `run` requirement on the proper version of the
  `sysroot_{subdir}` package so that it is only installed with CDTs from the
  right version of CentOS
- the versions of `sysroot_{conda subdir}` are 2.17 for CentOS 7 and 2.28 for Alma 8

## Azure CI Setup

This bit of code was run to setup azure.

```python
from conda_smithy.azure_ci_utils import register_repo, AzureConfig

cfg = AzureConfig(project_name='cdt-builds')
register_repo("conda-forge", "cdt-builds", config=cfg)
```
